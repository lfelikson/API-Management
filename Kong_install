Prepare your database or declarative configuration file

Kong can run either with or without a database.

When using a database, you will use the kong.conf configuration file for setting Kongâ€™s configuration properties at start-up and the database as storage of all configured entities, such as the Routes and Services to which Kong proxies.

When not using a database, you will use kong.conf its configuration properties and a kong.yml file for specifying the entities as a declarative configuration.

Using a database

Configure Kong so it can connect to your database. Kong supports both PostgreSQL 9.5+ and Cassandra 3.x.x as its datastore.

If you are using Postgres, please provision a database and a user before starting Kong, ie:

CREATE USER kong; CREATE DATABASE kong OWNER kong;


see https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/configuration/#database for detailes of how to copnfigure Kong with PostgreSQL DB 




Now, run the Kong migrations:

 $ kong migrations bootstrap [-c /path/to/kong.conf]
Note for Kong < 0.15: with Kong versions below 0.15 (up to 0.14), use the up sub-command instead of bootstrap. Also note that with Kong < 0.15, migrations should never be run concurrently; only one Kong node should be performing migrations at a time. This limitation is lifted for Kong 0.15, 1.0, and above.

Without a database

If you are going to run Kong in DB-less mode, you should start by generating declarative config file. The following command will generate a kong.yml file in your current folder. It contains instructions about how to fill it up.

 $ kong config init
After filling up the kong.yml file, edit your kong.conf file. Set the database option to off and the declarative_config option to the path of your kong.yml file:

 database = off
 declarative_config = /path/to/kong.yml

Start Kong

 $ kong start [-c /path/to/kong.conf]

Use Kong

Kong is running:

 $ curl -i http://localhost:8001/
