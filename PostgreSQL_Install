PostgreSQL packages for Debian and Ubuntu
The PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) maintains an APT repository of PostgreSQL packages for Debian and Ubuntu located at http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/. We aim at building PostgreSQL server packages as well as extensions and modules packages on several Debian/Ubuntu releases for all PostgreSQL versions supported.

Currently, we support

Debian 8 (jessie), 9 (stretch), 10 (buster), 11 (bullseye, amd64+ppc64), and unstable (sid)
Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial), 18.04 (bionic), 19.10 (eoan, amd64 only), 20.04 (focal, amd64+ppc64el)
Architectures: amd64 (64-bit x86), i386 (32-bit x86), ppc64el (little-endian 64-bit POWER)
PostgreSQL 9.5, 9.6, 10, 11, 12, 13 devel
Server extensions such as Slony-I, various PL languages, and datatypes
Applications like pgadmin4, omnidb, pgbouncer, and pgpool-II
Packages for older PostgreSQL versions and older Debian/Ubuntu distributions will continue to stay in the repository, but will in most cases not be updated anymore.

Quickstart
Import the repository key from https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc:

sudo apt-get install curl ca-certificates gnupg
curl https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
Create /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list. The distributions are called codename-pgdg. In the example, replace buster with the actual distribution you are using:

deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt buster-pgdg main
(You may determine the codename of your distribution by running lsb_release -c). For a shorthand version of the above, presuming you are using a supported release:

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
Finally, update the package lists, and start installing packages:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql-11 pgadmin4
Alternately, this shell script will automate the repository setup. The script is included in the postgresql-common package in Debian and Ubuntu, so you can also run it straight from there:

sudo apt install postgresql-common
sudo sh /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.sh
Note that the shell script leaves the source package repo (deb-src) commented out; if you need source packages, you will need to modify /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list to enable it.

Have a look at the FAQ.

Note: This repository provides "postgresql", "postgresql-contrib", and "postgresql-client" meta-packages that depend on the latest postgresql-x.y, ... packages, similar to the ones present in Debian and Ubuntu. Once a new PostgreSQL version is released, these meta-packages will be updated to depend on the new version. If you rather want to stay with a particular PostgreSQL version, you should install specific packages like "postgresql-11" instead of "postgresql".

For packages of development/alpha/beta versions of PostgreSQL, see the FAQ entry about beta versions.
